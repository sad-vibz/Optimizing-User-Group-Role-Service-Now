# 🧩 Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows

This project focuses on improving how **users, groups, and roles** are managed within the **ServiceNow** platform through optimized **Access Control** and **Workflow Automation**.  
The goal is to enhance efficiency, strengthen security, and streamline administrative tasks using ServiceNow’s built-in tools like **Flow Designer**, **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, and **Performance Analytics**.
